# Yibo's Digital Garden

This is a collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that I've written down over the years. It's a bit like a digital garden, a concept that I first learned about from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

## How to set up your own digital garden

If you're interested in setting up your own digital garden, here are a few resources to get you started:

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. `npm start` to start the development server
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Building and deploying to gh-pages

Make sure you have the `gh-pages` package installed *only for deployment*:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

Build with `npm run build` and deploy with `npm run deploy`.
